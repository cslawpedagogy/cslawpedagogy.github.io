            <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
            <p><b>Date:</b>Friday, July 18, 2025</p>
            <p><b>Place:</b>George Washington University, Washington, DC (co-located with PETS)</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b>
            Over the last couple of years there has been a mass proliferation of courses that intentionally put students from computing disciplines and students developing expertise in law and policy into a single classroom. These courses offer an exciting avenue to cultivate cross-disciplinary skills for students who hope to play translational roles during their careers or simply want to practice their own discipline in a more informed way.</p>
            <p>This workshop is aimed at faculty or TAs who teach these joint computer science, law, and policy courses (i.e. students who enroll both CS and law/policy students). The workshop will focus on sharing, developing and refining pedagogy for these classes. The workshop will feature invited speakers and have structured activities through which participants can share best practices, helpful pedagogical methods, lessons learned, and helpful resources for these courses. Through this workshop we will also build a community wiki-style website with the resources collected, that can be updated into the future; this collection of resources for teaching across these disciplines will help new and experienced faculty alike teach these courses.</p>
